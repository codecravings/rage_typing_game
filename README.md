# ðŸ”¥ RAGE TYPING GAME ðŸ”¥
> *"The game that made me question my career choices and my typing speed"*

## What is this digital torture device?
A Pygame-powered typing game that starts innocent ("cat", "dog") and ends with you crying over "cryptocurrency decentralization blockchain" flying at Mach 3.

## How to play (a.k.a. how to lose your sanity)
1. **Words fly at you** like your deadlines
2. **Type them correctly** before they escape (like your will to live)
3. **Progress through levels** that get exponentially more evil
4. **Watch your lives disappear** faster than your weekend plans

## Difficulty levels (from "meh" to "why god why")
- **Levels 1-3**: Baby words like "cat", "run" - basically insulting your intelligence
- **Levels 4-6**: Programming terms - starts getting personal
- **Levels 7-9**: Actual computer science - now you're questioning your degree
- **Level 10+**: Hacker terminology - time to question your life choices

## Features that will make you rage
- âœ… **Progressive difficulty** (because you weren't suffering enough)
- âœ… **Combo system** (miss one letter, lose everything)
- âœ… **Speed increases** (words accelerate like your anxiety)
- âœ… **Lives system** (3 chances to prove you're not a disappointment)
- âœ… **Score tracking** (so you can quantify your failure)

## Installation (if you hate yourself)
```bash
pip install pygame
python rage_typing_game_final.py
```

## Pro Tips from someone who lost
- Don't blink. Ever.
- Sacrifice your pinky finger for better reach
- Consider a career change to something less typing-intensive
- Keep tissues nearby for the inevitable tears

## High Score Strategy
There isn't one. The game always wins. You're just delaying the inevitable.
